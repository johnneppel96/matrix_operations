I created these matrix packages for the programming projects that I was assigned for my Operating Systems Analysis class. These projects allowed me to gain experience in writing multi-threaded programs.
The matrixMultiplication package will generate the product matrix that is the result of multiplying two matrices together.
The saddlePointMatrix package will find the saddle point(s) that may be located within a matrix. A saddle point is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.
